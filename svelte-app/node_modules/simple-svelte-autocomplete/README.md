Autocomplete / Select / Typeahead component made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) based on  https://github.com/tborychowski/svelte-autocomplete

* no dependencies
* use plain lists or array of objects 
* option to define a label field or function
* option to define more fields used for search

#### See live demo at http://simple-svelte-autocomplete.surge.sh/

Install the component:

```bash
npm i -D simple-svelte-autocomplete
```

Import the component and define items:

````javascript
import AutoComplete from "simple-svelte-autocomplete";

const colors = ["White", "Red", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Black"];
let selectedColor;
````

And use it like this:
````html
<AutoComplete items={colors} bind:selectedItem={selectedColor} />
````

You can also use it with array of objects:
````javascript
const colorList = [
  { id: 1, name: "White", code: "#FFFFFF" },
  { id: 2, name: "Red", code: "#FF0000" },
  { id: 3, name: "Yellow", code: "#FF00FF" },
  { id: 4, name: "Green", code: "#00FF00" },
  { id: 5, name: "Blue", code: "#0000FF" },
  { id: 6, name: "Black", code: "#000000" }
];

let selectedColorObject;
````
Just define which field should be used as label:
````html
<AutoComplete
  items={colorList}
  bind:selectedItem={selectedColorObject}
  labelFieldName="name" />
````

Specifying function for label instead of field name is also supported:
````html
<AutoComplete
  items={colorList}
  bind:selectedItem={selectedColorObject}
  labelFunction={color => color.id + '. ' + color.name} />
````

By default the component searches by the item label, but it can also search by custom fields by specifying `keywords` function. For example to enable searching by color name and color HEX code:
````html
<AutoComplete
  items={colorList}
  bind:selectedItem={selectedColorObject}
  labelFieldName="name"
  keywordsFunction={color => color.name + ' ' + color.code} />
````
